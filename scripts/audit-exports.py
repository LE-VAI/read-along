"""Audit the published package: every shipped file vs every file reachable
through the exports map.

A file present in `files` but absent from `exports` is published yet
unimportable — the exact defect that made read-along.css unreachable. This
script is the check that catches that class at publish time instead of
letting an integrator hit an unresolvable import path.

Usage:  python scripts/audit-exports.py     (from the package root)

Exit 0 when nothing shipped-but-required is blocked, 1 otherwise, so it can be
wired into a publish step.

TWO CORRECTIONS over the first version of this script, both the same class of
bug it exists to find — an instrument that misreports:

1. `str.lstrip("./")` strips CHARACTERS, not a prefix. For a path like
   `./src/analog.js` it removes the leading dot and slash (fine by luck), but
   for a path that is exactly `./`-free or begins with a run of dots/slashes it
   silently mangles the name. Replaced with an explicit prefix removal.

2. The first version reported LICENSE and README.md as "unreachable", which is
   noise — those are conventional, fetched by tooling rather than imported, and
   reporting them trains a reader to ignore the output. Now classified
   separately as EXPECTED, so the blocked list means something.

# Internal modules are legitimately unreachable: nothing should import them
# directly, and exposing them would freeze implementation details as API.
# Genuinely private: implementation detail a host has no reason to reach.
#
# THIS LIST WAS WRONG IN A WAY THAT MATTERED. It excused `tokenizer.js` and
# `timings.js` as "internal", but the README documents tokenizer.js as "the
# engine contract and token/chunk formats" and timings.js was already exported —
# so the list was excusing a real gap, and a host building the external-clock
# integration could not import the module that derives its own timings. That is
# the same defect this script exists to find, one level up: an instrument whose
# internal notion of "fine" had drifted from the packaged reality.
#
# The rule now: anything documented as a host contract is NOT internal, and
# this list holds only modules that are neither exported nor documented.
